                manipulates information or data. It can store, retrieve and process data. Whether it is a tiny cellphone
                or a large desktop computer, they both can be referred to as a computer.</p>

                    century, when Charles Babbage <em>(1791-1871)</em> started the new technological era, designing the
                    first machine that could automatically perform hard calculations. Later the range of new inventions
                    was made. It is important to note that there are 5 major generations that brought us new computer
                    improvements and led us to the point of the technological era where we are today.</p>

                software and hardware. These are the two main components that computer depends on. To keep it simple,
                hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer, while the software is the programs or apps that
                give all the instructions to the hardware about how to perform a specific task. (Mullins)</p>

                        hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD). Hard disk drives work by writing data onto
                        spinning magnetic disks called platters, while a solid-state drive stores data by using static

            <h2 class="header2 shadow_small margin_ident">Software</h2>
            <p>Software is one of the key factors when it comes to computers doing work. As it was previously mentioned,
                computer software is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to work using its hardware. It is
                crucial to understand that hardware without software is just some objects that don’t know how to work
                together, and software builds a team out of these objects. There are a lot of types of software that are
                focusing on different things. Starting from the operation system, and finishing up with the time
                management application. Although, generally all software is divided into 2 categories: system and
                application software.</p>

                    software</h3>
                <p>A system software aids the user and the hardware to function and interact with each other. Basically,
                    the system software is the middle layer between the user and the hardware. When you turn on the
                    computer, it is the system software that gets initialized and gets loaded in the memory of the
                    system. Usually, it runs in the background and is not used by the end-users. (Singh) Examples of
                    system software include:</p>

                            provides essential information regarding how the device interacts with other hardware.
                            (Singh) Some examples of firmware are BIOS, Consumer Applications, Embedded Systems, etc.

                    <p>These are mediator programs on which software programs rely to translate high-level language code
                        to simpler machine-level code (Singh). High-level language code is the code that the programmer
                        writes using common programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby and others. However, machines
                        cannot directly understand it because they speak using different variations of machine-level
                        code. Machine level languages are the languages that are not understandable for the vast
                        majority of people and programmers. Therefore, programming language translators are needed.</p>

                    software, and unlike system software, they are specific in their functionality and are used by the
                    computer user. Application Software or simply apps can also be referred to as non-essential software
                    and their absence does not affect the functioning of the system. (Singh) Examples of application
                    software include:</p>
