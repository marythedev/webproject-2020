                        As we talk about computers, usually we tend to refer to the PC or the laptop, although the
                        explanation of what computer actually is is far beyond that. A computer is an electronic device
                        that manipulates information or data. It can store, retrieve and process data. Whether it is a
                        tiny cellphone or a large desktop computer, they both can be referred to as a computer.

                <p>The history of the computer takes its roots way back from the 19th century, when Charles Babbage
                    <em>(1791-1871)</em> started the new technological era, designing the first machine that could
                    automatically perform hard calculations. Later the range of new inventions was made. It is important
                    to note that there are 5 major generations that brought us new computer improvements and led us to
                    the point of the technological era where we are today.

                    <h3>First generation - Vacuum Tubes (1946-1959)</h3>
                    <p>In 1946, J.P.Eckert and J.W.Mauchly invented the first successful electronic computer called
                        ENIAC (“Electronic Numeric Integrator And Calculator”) with the following human invention of
                        UNIVAC (1951), IBM-701 (1952) and other computers. These computers were unreasonably large
                        compared to today’s date ones, could weigh up to 30 tonnes, and consumed a lot of energy. Due to
                        their bulkiness, these computers were very costly and ordinary people could not afford them.

                    <p>Second generation computers were based on transistors instead of vacuum tubes, therefore were
                        they smaller and consumed less energy. Although they needed constant maintenance, as they were
                        relatively large to the current standards.

                    <p>The third generation of computers was based on integrated circuits. An integrated circuit was
                        invented by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby in 1959 and required a highly sophisticated technology,
                        as it was a single component containing a number of transistors.

                        unit (CPU) of a computer that was made on a single microelectronic chip. It contains millions of
                        tiny transistors, resistors, and other components that are combined in one chip. In addition to
                        that, such computers were equipped with GUI (Graphics User Interface) technology that offered
                        more
                        comfort and easiness to its users, and which is used up to this day.

                    <h3>Fifth generation - Artificial Intelligence (AI) (1980-present)</h3>
                    <p>The main mission of artificial intelligence is to make a device that could respond to natural
                        language input and is capable of learning and self-organization. The world of information
                        technology (IT) is still trying to solve this problem. During the time of fifth generation
                        computers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones and many other new user-friendly computers
                        were invented. Currently, the tech companies offer us various types of computers, starting from
                        the large desktop computers to the tiny smartwatches that can make a video call with your
                        friends on the other side of the Earth.

            <h1 class="center">Hardware <span>vs</span> Software</h1>
            <p>Nowadays, without a doubt, the computer is the number one helper of the human without whom life would be
                much harder. However, what is the computer itself? How does it have those abilities to store, retrieve,
                and process our data? To better explain it, let’s start off with the 2 basic terms: software and
                hardware. These are the two main components that computer depends on. To keep it simple, hardware refers
                to the physical elements of a computer, while the software is the programs or apps that give the
                instructions to the hardware parts about how to perform a specific task.

                        speed at which the processor processes information, is measured in gigahertz (GHz). The higher
                        the GHz rating the processor has, the faster it will perform.

                    <h4>Motherboard</h4>
                    <p>The motherboard is at the center of what makes a computer work, and is home to one of the most
                        important pieces of hardware - the processor. Motherboard generally acts as a brain, it
                        allocates power where it’s needed, communicating with and coordinating across all other
                        components – making it one of the most important pieces of hardware in a computer.

                    <h4>Hard Drive</h4>
                    <p>The hard drive is a storage device responsible for all of the computer's data. For example, when
                        you save an important document or a programming code file, you are saving them to your
                        computer's hard drive. There are two different types of hard drives: hard disk drive (HDD) and
                        solid-state drives (SSD). Hard disk drives work by writing data onto spinning magnetic disks
                        called platters, while a solid-state drive stores data by using memory chips.

                    <h4>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h4>
                    <p>RAM is the temporary memory that is installed in the memory slots of the motherboard. It is
                        temporary as it temporarily stores “on-the-fly” information created by programs that makes data
                        immediately accessible (computer doesn't need to spend time looking for information on the hard
                        drive). However, once the computer is shut down, everything that is stored in RAM gets deleted
                        (unlike the permanent storage on hard drive). The tasks that require random memory could be
                        editing video or photographs, multi-tasking with multiple apps open, etc.

                    <h4>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h4>
                    <p>A power supply is a point where power enters your system from an external power source and is
                        then allocated by the motherboard to individual component hardware. Not all power supplies are
                        made equally, and without the right wattage PSU your computer will fail to work. Computers that
                        are used for highly intensive tasks such as graphic design or gaming will require more powerful
                        components and thus will need more powerful PSU to cater to this additional need.

            <h3>Peripheral Devices</h3>
            <p>A peripheral device is a piece of computer hardware that is added to a computer in order to expand its
                abilities (like scanner, printer, mouse etc.). Yet it doesn’t necessarily have to be present in order
                for a computer to perform its task (to store, retrieve, and process data). Examples of peripheral
                devices include:

                    <h4>Webcamera</h4>
                    <p>Webcamera is a video input device. They can be external and connect to the computer or built into
                        the computer itself. Webcameras are most often used to enable people to see each other when
                        communicating via the internet.

            <p>Software is one of the key factors when it comes to computers doing work. As it was previously mentioned,
                computer software is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to work using its hardware. It is
                crucial to understand that hardware without software is just some objects that don’t know how to work
                together, and software builds a team out of these objects. There are a lot of types of software that are
                focusing on different things. Starting from the operation system, and finishing up with the time
                management application. Although, generally all software is divided into 2 categories: system and
                application software.

            <h3>System software</h3>
            <p>A system software aids the user and the hardware to function and interact with each other. Basically, the
                system software is the middle layer between the user and the hardware. When you turn on the computer, it
                is the system software that gets initialized and gets loaded in the memory of the system. Usually, it
                runs in the background and doesn't directly interact with the end-users. Examples of system software
                include:

                    <h4>Firmware</h4>
                    <p>Firmware is the permanent software that is embedded into a read-only memory. It is a set of
                        instructions permanently stored on a hardware device. These instructions provide computer
                        information regarding how hardware parts should interact. The most prominent example of firmware
                        is BIOS.

                    <h4>Operating System (OS)</h4>
                    <p>An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware resources and provides essential
                        services for running applications. Every device, whether a desktop, laptop or mobile phone
                        requires an operating system to provide the basic functionality to it. There are various types
                        of operating systems. Some examples of operating systems are Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, Unix,
                        MS Windows.

                    <h4>Device Drivers</h4>
                    <p>Driver is a special type of software designed to facilitate communication between the operating
                        system and specific hardware component, such as a graphics card, printer, monitor, etc. The
                        driver ensures the proper functioning of the component, enabling the operating system to utilize
                        its capabilities and ensuring the stable operation of the device.

            <h4>Programming Language Translators</h4>
            <p class="small-padding">These mediator programs translate high-level language code to simpler machine-level
                code. High-level language code is the code that the programmer writes using common programming languages
                like Python, Java, Ruby and others. However, machines cannot directly understand it because they speak
                only using different variations of machine-level code. Machine level languages are the languages that
                are not understandable for the vast majority of people and programmers. Therefore, programming language
                translators are needed.

            <h3>Application software (Apps)</h3>
            <p>Apps is software that helps users perform various tasks (such as taking notes, setting alarms, playing
                games, etc.). Applications are at a higher level than system software and designed for specific
                purposes. The absence of applications is insignificant and does not impact the functioning of the
                system. Examples of application software include:
