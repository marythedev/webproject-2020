            <p class="bold">As we talk about computers, usually we tend to refer to the PC or the laptop, although
                the explanation of what computer actually is is far beyond that. A computer is an electronic device that
                manipulates information or data. It can store, retrieve and process data. Whether it is a tiny cellphone
                or a large desktop computer, they both can be referred to as a computer.

                    century, when Charles Babbage <em>(1791-1871)</em> started the new technological era, designing the
                    first machine that could automatically perform hard calculations. Later the range of new inventions
                    was made. It is important to note that there are 5 major generations that brought us new computer
                    improvements and led us to the point of the technological era where we are today.

                life would be much harder. However, what is the computer itself? How does it have those abilities to
                store, retrieve, and process our data? To better explain it, let’s start off with the 2 basic terms:
                software and hardware. These are the two main components that computer depends on. To keep it simple,
                hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer, while the software is the programs or apps that
                give the instructions to the hardware parts about how to perform a specific task.

                        coordinating across all other components – making it one of the most important pieces of

                        you are saving them to your computer's hard drive. There are two different types of hard drives:
                        hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD). Hard disk drives work by writing data onto
                        spinning magnetic disks called platters, while a solid-state drive stores data by using memory

                        looking for information on the hard drive). However, once the computer is shut down, everything
                        that is stored in RAM gets deleted (unlike the permanent storage on hard drive). The tasks that
                        require random memory could be editing video or photographs, multi-tasking with multiple apps

                <p>A system software aids the user and the hardware to function and interact with each other. Basically,
                    the system software is the middle layer between the user and the hardware. When you turn on the
                    computer, it is the system software that gets initialized and gets loaded in the memory of the
                    system. Usually, it runs in the background and doesn't directly interact with the end-users.
                    Examples of system software include:

                    <p>These mediator programs translate high-level language code to simpler machine-level code.
                        High-level language code is the code that the programmer writes using common programming
                        languages like Python, Java, Ruby and others. However, machines cannot directly understand it
                        because they speak only using different variations of machine-level code. Machine level
                        languages are the languages that are not understandable for the vast majority of people and
                        programmers. Therefore, programming language translators are needed.
