# Co-op Website Project

Hellooo, **Thank you** for checking out this project!<br/>
I'd like to present this website I build some time ago to introduce people to Software Development. Hope this website will help someone discover something new or ignite a spark of interest to learn new skills! Besides, this website features information about Toronto-based technology company, where I had a wonderful co-op experience!

Here's what you can discover:
* Home ***OR*** My experience at the co-op placement
  * Company's mission
  * Work environment
* Knowledge
  * History of computers
  * Software vs Hardware
  * Hardware & Software types
* Skills
  * Interpersonal skills
  * Professional skills (for Web developers)
  * Resources to learn Web development
* Careers
  * Tech jobs, their essential skills & salaries
  * Famous companies for career perspectives
* References for the provided information
